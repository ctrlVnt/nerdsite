    "aboutme": "I am a PhD student in IRMAR (University of Rennes) and Institut Fourier (University of Grenoble Alpes), since September 2021.\nI work under the supervision of Michel Brion and Matthieu Romagny.\nMy research is mainly about the geometry of projective homogeneous varieties over fields of positive characteristic.\nRelated subjects I am interested in are birational geometry and representation theory of reductive groups.\nMy first projects were about classifying non-reduced parabolic subgroups in small characteristics.\nHere is my CV."
