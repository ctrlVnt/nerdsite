        "title": "∞-Dold-Kan correspondence via representation theory",
        "description": "Both Happel and Ladkani proved that, for commutative rings, the quiver An is derived equivalent to the diagram generated by An where any composition of two consecutive arrows vanishes. We give a purely derivator-theoretic reformulation and proof of this result showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provi…",

        "description": "Following the article of C. M. Ringel we introduce preprojective algebras of a Dynkin quiver Q starting from three definitions which, despite concerning completely different algebraic structures, turn out to be equivalent. Our main result is a new version of Ringel's proofs that applies a theorem by Happel and exploits the techniques of homological algebra. Moreover we show that the definition o…",
